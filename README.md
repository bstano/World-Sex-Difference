# World Sex Differences

A very simple and basic project where I visualized and compared the population of various different countires through the lens of population sex ratio, using UN population data. 

I found that there were some surprisingly strong trends between expected population growth and sex ratio. Interestingly, having more males than females appears to increase the likelihood of future population increases. Of course, this is contrary to the idea that having more females would lead to more births. 

The code in this project is slightly lengthy as I still forming my python skills at the time.
